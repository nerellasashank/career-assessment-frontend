Let's break down this React component, ArtistProfile, step by step:

1. Import Statements
import React, { useState } from 'react';


What it does: This imports React from the React library, which is essential for building React components.
 It also imports useState, which is a React hook used to manage the state of the component (i.e., values that can change over time).

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Component Declaration

const ArtistProfile = ({ user, onProfileSubmit, onPhotoChange }) => 


What it does: This defines a functional component called ArtistProfile. The component receives three props:
user: The current userâ€™s data (like username, email, etc.).
onProfileSubmit: A function to handle the submission of the profile updates (passed from the parent component).
onPhotoChange: A function to notify the parent component about the profile photo change (passed from the parent component).

3. State Variables

const [username, setUsername] = useState(user?.username || '');
const [email, setEmail] = useState(user?.email || '');
const [password, setPassword] = useState(user?.password || '');
const [newPassword, setNewPassword] = useState('');
const [showPasswordField, setShowPasswordField] = useState(false);
const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');
const [profilePhoto, setProfilePhoto] = useState(null);
const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState('');



What it does: This block initializes state variables using the useState hook.

username, email, and password: These hold the user's profile information (fetched from user prop). 
user?.attributes ==> it is way of getting the attributes values of a data send using props by parent component to this component.

newPassword: A state to store the new password (if the user decides to change it).

showPasswordField: A boolean state to control whether the password input field should be shown or not (used for toggling password change).

errorMessage: A state for storing error messages, like if the image upload fails.

profilePhoto and imageUrl: These hold the URL of the uploaded profile photo (used to display and update the user's profile image).
